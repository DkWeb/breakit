# BreakIt
This is a very simple canvas2d based breakout version, using my own persistence and particle libraries. It is just a very tiny project based on the breakout clone developed by Chris DeLeon during his [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-program-games/).
I've enhanced the version of the course to have a funnier gaming experience and to have some playground for my libraries.

You can have a try with the game under <https://dkweb.github.io/breakit/>
